REPUTATION IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN TRAFFIC

theyworkforaz :
    files are all from nov 30 onwards in basecamp

home page notes:
    top right field autocompletes - addresses, zip codes, town names, rep/senator names, issues, bill names, committee names, district names, party <-- all of these entities have pages
    track anything that's a result : track blanket stuff within your district, individual reps/sens, issues, bills, committee activity, party activity <-- all of these entities
    track az issues search, merge into top right field, not lower
    
issues percentages:
    what they worked on
        bill sponsorship
        bill co-sponsorship
        bill activity - how many times has this appeared before committees and houses
        bill activity - how many hours of video has been recorded for a bill
        how many versions of the bill
        how long the bill is
        
"campaign tracking" - secondary space ideas:
    1. pertinent news stories to the particular topic
    2. campaign tracking
    
district pointer:
    ask nathan about how it moves
    
senator/rep page:
    key votes:
        currently from vote smart
        could we build this based upon users concerns, rather than highlighted bills
        public appearances and interest group ratings are from votesmart
    "Yard Sign":
        some kind of display of support on facebook for a politician...
    social network graph

issue page:
    votes etc pull from votesmart
    committee listings for issues - this is a manual thing per committee per session per issue
    blue highlight is for your reps on the committees
    bills / votes on issues - auto-categorise, but possibly with a human filter first?
    right hand side, people you're tracking/district you're tracking..
    bottom left - links to external sites (manual)
    If there's a huge list, link out to an external list.

google earth:
    export various bits of AZ geodata to google earth for visualisation

no commentary, no petitions, at least in this phase - consider linking out to hashtags on things like twitter - reputation is more important than traffic
