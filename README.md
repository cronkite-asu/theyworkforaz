=====================
They Work for Arizona
=====================

This is a project for notifications of votes for a constituents Arizona legislature representatives.  It's somewhat inspired by small parts of "theyworkforyou" in the UK.

It's currently not in a usable state. I'd love contributions, however.

If you'd like to contribute, this project depends on django.  It also depends on the dependencies of geodjango.  You probably want to run this with a postGIS database.
